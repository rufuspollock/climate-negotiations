# COP PLENARY

### OPENING SESSION

COP-7 President Mohamed Elyazghi (Morocco)  declared COP-8 open. He drew attention to the Marrakesh Accords,  noting that the process has moved to implementation.

The COP elected T.R. Baalu, Indian Minister of Environment and  Forests as COP-8 President by acclamation. COP-8 President Baalu  welcomed participants, noting that impacts of climate change are  already being felt. He stressed implementation, and highlighted  those most vulnerable to climate change and the need for  adaptation. He said that a consensus-based 'Delhi Declaration'  addressing climate change and sustainable development would be an  important COP-8 outcome.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter stressed the linkage  between poverty and environment made at the WSSD. On facilitating  information exchange between Parties, she explained that the  Secretariat would do so by hosting authoritative databases of  emissions, and of policies and measures (P&Ms).

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

The Secretariat noted that 185 states and  1 regional organization have ratified the UNFCCC. He said  Afghanistan had deposited its instrument of ratification on 19  September. On the provisional agenda (FCCC/CP/2002/1, Add.1 and  Add.2), the G-77/CHINA urged exclusion of Canada's proposal for a  decision on modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts  under Protocol Article 7.4 (registries) in relation to cleaner  energy exports. The EU said this issue would be addressed by the  SBI. He opposed Saudi Arabia's request to include discussion on  implementation of Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of P&Ms)  on the agenda. SAUDI ARABIA said the issue was unfinished business  from the BAPA and stressed preparation of a draft decision for  COP/MOP-1. CANADA emphasized the cleaner energy proposal as a  priority for the future success of the Protocol. The agenda was  adopted with these items, and the issue of the second review of  the adequacy of commitments, held in abeyance.

President Baalu noted that consultations continued on the election  of officers other than the President. He said the high-level  segment would take place in the form of three consecutive round- tables on 30 and 31 October on the theme of climate change and  sustainable development.

The G-77/CHINA expressed disappointment at the low level of  financial resources provided by Annex I Parties, stressing that  action so far has been symbolic. Supported by AUSTRALIA, for the  Umbrella Group, he underscored the importance of linking  sustainable development and climate change. Stressing the  principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, CHINA  said the climate regime should take into account the rising energy  demands that will occur as the quality of life in developing  countries improves. ZIMBABWE, for the Africa Group, called for  increased support for adaptation projects.

# SBSTA

### OPENING SESSION

SBSTA Chair Halldór Thorgeirsson (Iceland) opened  the session. Noting that the SBSTA vice-chair had resigned, he  said a replacement nomination was expected from GRULAC. Tatyana  Osokova (Uzbekistan) will serve as rapporteur. The SBSTA adopted  the provisional agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/7).

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Review of methodological work under the  UNFCCC and Protocol: The Secretariat introduced a report on this  new agenda item, highlighting five priority topics related to:  greenhouse gas inventories; emissions and removals by sinks; P&Ms;  mitigation and adaptation technologies; and impacts, vulnerability  and adaptation of climate change.

The EU, NORWAY, SAUDI ARABIA and NEW ZEALAND supported  consideration of the item beyond SBSTA-17. INDIA highlighted a  recent workshop enhancing developing country capacity. The US  cautioned against the Secretariat moving beyond its mandate in  initiating work. Harald Dovland (Norway) will undertake  consultations.

###     Guidelines under Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8

On guidelines for  the preparation of information required under Article 7 and for  review under Article 8 and good practice guidance for Article 5.2  (adjustments), Chair Thorgeirsson highlighted outstanding issues  to be addressed, including: options for the treatment of  confidential data during review; training and capacity building  for expert review teams; technical standards for data exchange  between national registries, the CDM registry and the transaction  log; and reporting and review of information on assigned amounts  and national registries. The EU welcomed progress on options for  the terms of service for lead reviewers and the training of  experts. He supported a proposal on developing case studies on the  calculation of adjustments under Article 5.2. The US stressed the  importance of options for the treatment of confidential data and  encouraged transparency of inventory data. SAUDI ARABIA said  training of review experts should include developing country  experts. Chair Thorgeirsson convened a contact group chaired by  Helen Plume (New Zealand) and Festus Leboyera (South Africa).

On technical standards for registries under Article 7.4, Murray  Ward (New Zealand) reported on the outcome of inter-sessional  consultations held in New Delhi, 19-20 October 2002. He outlined  agreement on: the need for a common standards framework; the need  to engage technical experts; a future focus on detailed registry  design; and continued collaboration with the UNFCCC Secretariat.  Chair Thorgeirsson invited Ward to conduct further consultations.

###     Guidelines on reporting and review of greenhouse gas inventories

The Secretariat reported on the latest national greenhouse gas  inventory data from Annex I Parties for 1990 to 2000. He said  greenhouse gas emissions and removals data is available from 39  out of 40 Annex I Parties.

###     Special circumstances of Croatia under UNFCCC Article 4.6

CROATIA  introduced a new technical paper. YUGOSLAVIA, opposed by the EU,  said it could not support Croatia's 1990 baseline proposal. Chair  Thorgeirsson asked Jim Penman (UK) to convene an informal contact  group.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Chair Thorgeirsson highlighted the annual  Expert Group on Technology Transfer's (EGTT) progress report and  the report on the implementation of activities under decision  4/CP.7. He also noted the EGTT's new work programme annexed to the  SBSTA-16 report. EGTT Chair Jukka Uosukainen (Finland) briefed  Parties on the Group's meeting preceding COP-8. He said  discussions had focused on technology needs assessment, technology  information sharing, capacity building, enabling environments and  financial support. He welcomed the newly elected EGTT Chair  William Bonsu (Ghana) and vice-chair William Bradley (US). Belgium  supported an EGTT workshop on enabling environments in 2003. G-77/CHINA said technology transfer to developing countries has been  ineffective. He welcomed new initiatives such as the Climate  Technology Initiative and urged assistance for both mitigation and  adaptation. INDIA stressed that piecemeal approaches are  unsatisfactory and supported consideration of access to resources,  institutional capacity building, and business community  participation.

# SBI

### OPENING SESSION

SBI Chair Raúl Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) opened  the first meeting of SBI-17 and the agenda was adopted.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Improvement of guidelines: The Secretariat introduced the proposed  improved guidelines for non-Annex I national communications and  the compilation of Parties' submissions. Presenting an overview of  funding for the initial national communications, the GEF noted 137  countries had received US$ 80 million, which represents 8% of  total funding under its climate change focal area. The GEF  expressed concern about the inestimable funding requirements of  proposed guidelines for developing local emissions factors and on  vulnerability and adaptation assessments, and remarked that  without these funding requirements would only be marginally higher  than current levels.

The EU said that LDC national adaptation programmes of action  should be considered in national communications. The CENTRAL  AFRICAN REPUBLIC, with BANGLADESH and ERITREA, highlighted LDCs'  difficulties in developing national communications and called on  SBSTA to address financial support. INDIA, supported by THAILAND  and IRAN, noted that the improved guidelines should not exceed the  UNFCCC's reporting requirements. CANADA, with the EU, highlighted  the need for demand-driven financing. TUVALU drew attention to  possible negative implications of tying adaptation finance to the  completion of national communications. JAPAN called for the  chair's text to reflect a balance between mitigation and  adaptation reporting requirements.

### CGE

The Secretariat introduced Parties' submissions. CGE Chair  Mahendra Kumar (Fiji) presented the final report of the CGE,  stressing that the CGE process plays an important role in  capacity-building through the sharing of experiences, and the  evaluation of technical problems and constraints. The CGE proposed  several recommendations, including that additional financial and  technical resources be mobilized, and that the IPCC develop  methods and tools for assessing impacts on time scales relevant to  policy-makers. SBI Chair Estrada said a contact group chaired by  José Romero (Switzerland) would consider the agenda item.

###     Compilation and synthesis

On the consideration of the fourth  compilation and synthesis of initial national communications of  non-Annex I countries, Chair Estrada said that the Secretariat  would prepare a report to be addressed at SBI-18.

### ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

The Secretariat introduced the  status report on the review of the third national communications.  Chair Estrada said that Parties would discuss, among other issues,  possible dates for the submission of the fourth national  communications.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

A contact group, convened by Helen Plume and  Festus Luboyera met in the afternoon. The G-77/CHINA requested  more time to consider the relevant documents. Delegates discussed  the timing for expedited review procedures for reinstatement of  eligibility to use the mechanisms. On the pending parts of the  guidelines under Articles 7 and 8, the EU circulated a paper on  preventing and resolving technical problems and discrepancies in  the technical standards and reporting and review text. Delegates  endorsed a proposal for case studies under Protocol Article 5.2.  Turning to the training of experts in review teams, the  Secretariat highlighted plans for a pilot training programme. On  the treatment of confidential data, delegates exchanged  preliminary views, and decided to forward the issue to SBSTA-18.

### CGE

Parties discussed GEF support for initial national  communications and the funding implications of the proposed  improved guidelines late into the night.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

With both the outgoing and incoming COP Presidents stressing that  the climate change process is shifting from drafting to  implementation, the lack of buzz in the halls of the Vigyan Bhawan  seemed to confirm that the action is elsewhere. Many conference  participants remarked that this COP seemed as low-key as a meeting  of the subsidiary bodies. However, other observers said they were  excited to meet a multitude of Southern NGOs that are not normally  at COPs.
