# INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

Delegates exchanged views on compliance during informal  consultations and were presented with a synthesis of submissions  by Parties. Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand, AOSIS, South  Africa and the US made submissions. Harald Dovland (Norway) and  Espen Rønneberg, (Marshall Islands) were nominated to co-chair  the joint working group on compliance.

# BRIEFING ON THE TECHNICAL WORKSHOPS

SBSTA Chair Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia) and SBI Vice Chair Mohammad  Reza Salamat (Iran) briefed delegates on the Technical Workshop  on Protocol Mechanisms held from 9-15 April 1999 in Bonn-Bad  Godesberg, Germany. Key topics at the workshop included  reference to case/baseline methodologies, additionality,  verification and reporting in relation to the clean development  mechanism (CDM) and Article 6 (joint implementation) projects.  Further issues discussed included the validation and funding of  projects under the CDM, the adaptation component and reporting,  verification and accountability related to emissions trading.  Participants also exchanged views on capacity building for  developing countries.

# SBSTA

Chair Chow emphasized SBSTA's role in ensuring that the Buenos  Aires Plan of Action's goals are met. He drew attention to the  election at COP-4 of Lambert Gnapelet (Central African Republic)  as SBSTA Vice Chair and Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia) as Rapporteur.

Michael Zammit Cutajar, FCCC Executive Secretary, emphasized  COP-5's importance as a potential 'stepping stone' to produce  outcomes that strengthen and maintain national capacities for  developing countries and economies in transition. He said the  subsidiary body sessions should identify what COP-5 needs to  achieve and what other meetings and workshops are needed to help  implement COP-6's objectives.

Regarding SBSTA's agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/1), Chair Chow noted  that both SBSTA and SBI would consider agenda items on adverse  effects, compliance, AIJ in the pilot phase, and mechanisms  under the Kyoto Protocol. He reported the proposal to defer  consideration of the impact of single projects on emissions in  the commitment period and the scientific and methodological  aspects of the proposal by Brazil (allocation of  responsibilities among emitters based on historical emissions)  to SBSTA-11. ICELAND supported this proposal.

SAUDI ARABIA, supported by CHINA and INDIA, said some issues may  not be adequately dealt with and suggested SBSTA and SBI jointly  address common agenda items. CHINA expressed concern over the  possible closure of the activities implemented jointly (AIJ)  pilot phase and smooth transition to project implemented under  Protocol Articles 6 (joint implementation) and 12 (CDM), stating  that current experience is inadequate. He questioned how AIJ can  make a transition to Article 6 and Article 12 projects, noting  that AIJ is supposed to be between Annex I and non-Annex I  Parties and does not result in credits, while Article 6 projects  are between or among developed country Parties.

On cooperation with relevant scientific organizations, Robert  Watson, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC), noted that IPCC now has its most intense work programme  ever, largely in response to requests from SBSTA or the FCCC,  and said it now faces a significant budget problem that will  require more funding from governments. He noted IPCC's  acceptance of the Special Report on 'Aviation and the Global  Atmosphere,' as well as the list of Policy-relevant Scientific  Questions that will be addressed in the Synthesis Report of the  Third Assessment Report (TAR). He also noted significant  progress on preparation of the TAR. Several delegates, including  AUSTRALIA, the EU, and JAPAN, called for steps to resolve IPCC's  funding problems.

On cooperation with other UN bodies, the Secretariat drew  attention to collaboration with UNCTAD, UNDP, UNEP and UNIDO.  SAUDI ARABIA and SWITZERLAND called for the scope of future  efforts to be widened beyond the Protocol mechanisms. The  GAMBIA, the MARSHALL ISLANDS, and ZIMBABWE emphasized the  importance of capacity building, particularly for non-Annex I  Parties. TANZANIA and ZIMBABWE called for elaboration of what  capacity building means and said the focus should be on  strengthening national capacities. UNEP said it had been  collaborating with the FCCC Secretariat on a capacity-building  project relating to CDM and directed at developing countries and  economies in transition.

On cooperation with other conventions, Chair Chow noted the  emphasis placed on cooperation with the Convention to Combat  Desertification (CCD) and the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD).  Gregoire de Kalbermatten, CCD Secretariat, said as the issues  addressed by FCCC, CCD and CBD are intimately connected,  initiatives to build stronger links should be encouraged. He  stated that the benefits of inter-Convention synergies would not  be fully realized as long as resources were lacking,  particularly in developing countries. Kalemani Mulongoy, CBD  Secretariat, highlighted areas where SBSTA-10 could assist the  CBD's work programme, including: considering the best modalities  to address coral bleaching, possibly through the organization of  a joint expert activity; furthering the understanding of forest  biological diversity and climate change interactions; and  contributing climate-related content to CBD's work on education  and public awareness.

On education, training and public awareness, Chair Chow noted  that since only three submissions had been received, the  Secretariat was unable to formulate proposals on how to  integrate this issue into SBSTA's work programme and proposed  setting a new date for submissions. The EU suggested further  pursuing education and public awareness in the work on 'good  practices' in policies and measures. He called on the  Secretariat to advise on the likely costs of undertaking further  work on education, training and public awareness. The REPUBLIC  OF KOREA noted the need for a technical guide to support  developing countries and welcomed the participation of the  private sector in promoting awareness activities.

On research and systematic observation, Kirk Dawson, Global  Climate Observatory Systems (GCOS) reported on activities  undertaken in response to the decisions of SBSTA-9 and COP-4. He  stressed the need for, inter alia: greater guidance for Parties'  submissions on national plans and programmes for systematic  observation; long term funding for ongoing operations; and  systems consistent with infrastructural levels in developing  countries. He said GCOS was exploring the establishment of an  intergovernmental board to provide guidance on addressing  priority issues and proposing a series of implementation  meetings that could also be used to identify regional scientific  policy or funding issues. He called for SBSTA's assistance in  mobilizing the necessary resources.

# SBI

Chair Bakary Kante introduced the new officers, Mohammad Reza  Salamat (Iran), Vice-Chair of SBI and Klaus Radunsky (Austria),  Rapporteur. He said that, following consultations with the COP  Bureau, the second review of adequacy of commitments would be  addressed at COP-6; Turkey's request to be taken out of Annex I  would be discussed in the run-up to COP-5; and Kazakhstan's  request to amend Annex I would be on the provisional agenda for  COP-5.

The PHILIPPINES, supported by CHINA, objected to wording in the  agenda item on non-Annex I communications referring to the  'process' for considering national communications, suggesting  instead 'matters related to the consideration of non-Annex I  communications.' CHINA, with the PHILIPPINES and the REPUBLIC OF  KOREA, said the item on the timing of second non-Annex I  communications was premature, as only 11 developing countries  had submitted first national communications. He attributed this  delay to the GEF. SAUDI ARABIA, supported by BOTSWANA, said the  implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol  Articles 2.3 and 3.14 (adverse effects) should be dealt with in  a joint session.

SWITZERLAND stated that while this SBI session should advance as  many elements of the Buenos Aires Programme of Action as  possible, it should also strive to make progress on  implementation of the Convention, particularly Articles 4.8, 4.9  and 12. He called for a strong and enforceable compliance regime  and reliable procedures for verification and certification.

On the consideration of non-Annex I Parties' communications, the  PHILIPPINES questioned the purpose of this agenda item, as the  Convention calls for consideration of national communications by  all Parties. The EU, with the US, said proper consideration of  initial national communications should result in improved second  national communications. He stated that national communications  can help identify further means to assist non-Annex I Parties in  their efforts to implement Article 12 (communication of  information) and indicated the need for a COP decision on the  consideration process before the timing of second national  communications is decided. The US said the revision of  guidelines was key to improving second national communications  and proposed expanding the guidelines to provide for, inter  alia, broader coverage and disaggregation of greenhouse gases  (GHG) inventories and information on GHG emission trends.  AUSTRALIA supported revision of guidelines for non-Annex I  communications and said it should conclude before the lodgement  date of second national communications. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA  said consideration of non-Annex I Parties' communications should  identify their financial and technical difficulties in GHG  limitation and should be undertaken when more non-Annex I Party  communications are available.

On provision of financial and technical support for the  preparation of non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA  inquired about the non-inclusion of an agenda item on the  financial mechanism and said timing of second national  communications for non-Annex I countries was subject to  availability of financial resources. The EU highlighted benefits  to developing countries from preparation of national  communications. JAPAN expected the GEF to be utilized  effectively but would consider other means to enhance developing  country capacity building to accelerate the preparation of  national communications. TOGO emphasized the need to involve  local experts. The US proposed a technical assessment of  individual GHG inventories and a forum for countries that have  submitted communications to exchange experiences. BRAZIL  stressed the need to involve all the relevant sectors creating  national inventories as it would generate awareness and  contribute to more credible numbers. At the request of several  Parties, Chair Kante agreed to resume discussion of this topic  on Tuesday afternoon.

On inputs of Parties to the GEF review of enabling activities,  the EU and US supported Switzerland's written proposal that all  bilateral and multilateral contributions, not just GEF efforts,  be taken into consideration. The G-77/CHINA requested more  information on the review process. Chair Kante said the  Secretariat would take these comments into consideration in  preparing its report.

On implementation of Articles 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects), the  Chair conveyed the decision of the SBI/SBSTA Chairs to set up a  Friends of the Chair group, consisting of the Vice-Chair of SBI,  Coordinator of the G-77/China, the EU, EIT and JUSCANZ, to  finalize the workshop's terms of reference on the issue.
