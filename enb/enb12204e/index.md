abstract: "The Eighth Conference of the Parties (COP-8) to the UNFCCC  continued to meet today in sessions of the SBSTA and SBI, COP  plenary, and several formal and informal contact groups. An  informal exchange of views on the Delhi Declaration was also held."
---

The SBSTA considered: cooperation with relevant international  organizations; UNFCCC Article 6 (education, training and public  awareness); cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy; and  the implementation of Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of  P&Ms). The SBI addressed: progress on the implementation of  activities under decision 5/CP.7 (adverse effects); matters  relating to least developed countries (LDCs); arrangements for  intergovernmental meetings; and the Croatian proposal on its  forest cap. The COP plenary discussed follow-up to the World  Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) and the report of the CDM  Executive Board. Contact groups on the Consultative Group of  Experts (CGE) on non-Annex I national communications, Article 6,  and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) under the CDM  also met.

# SBSTA

### COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The Secretariat  presented a scoping paper on cross-cutting thematic areas under  the UNFCCC, the United Nations Convention to Combat  Desertification (UNCCD) and Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), and  presented WSSD outcomes on synergies between these conventions.  Parties discussed thematic areas, diverging on the terms of  reference for a workshop. Chair Thorgeirsson requested a contact  group, co-chaired by Jimena Nieto (Colombia) and Outi Berghäll  (Finland), to resolve outstanding issues and prepare draft  conclusions.

### ARTICLE 6

The World Conservation Union (IUCN) and UNEP outlined  their activities related to the implementation of Article 6.  TUNISIA, with SENEGAL and CANADA, supported designating a climate  change day. BELGIUM offered to host a regional workshop on Article  6 in 2003. The US cautioned against linking discussion on Article  6 to reporting and financing issues. A contact group will be  convened by Fatu Gaye (Gambia) and Jean-Pascal van Ypersele  (Belgium).

### OTHER MATTERS

Cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy:  CANADA introduced draft decision text supported by NEW ZEALAND,  POLAND, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and SLOVENIA, and opposed by SAUDI  ARABIA for the G-77/CHINA, SWITZERLAND, and the US. The text  requests the Secretariat to ask competent organizations to analyze  the role of trade in cleaner energy in meeting the objective of  the UNFCCC and the Protocol, and to report back to SBSTA-21.  Several Parties reaffirmed their objection to Canada's original  proposal on accounting for cleaner energy exports. The EU said  that only generic issues relating to trade in cleaner energy  should be discussed. Chair Thorgeirsson will undertake  consultations on this issue.

###     Implementation of Protocol Article 2.3

Parties discussed issues  relating to possible workshops. SAUDI ARABIA argued for a draft  decision requesting the Secretariat to analyse the adverse effects  of P&Ms on developing countries. Chair Thorgeirsson said he would  undertake consultations on this issue.

# SBI

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Progress on implementation of activities under  decision 5/CP.7: Parties discussed implementation issues on  adverse effects, as well as outcomes of a workshop on modeling  held in Bonn in May 2002, and arrangements for workshops on  insurance and risk assessment.

The G-77/CHINA expressed concern about the lack of financial  support for the implementation of the decision. Addressing the  lack of funding for the workshops on insurance and risk assessment,  she called for a mechanism to finance the workshops and proposed  creating an expert group on adaptation. CANADA expressed interest  in supporting the workshops. Several Parties stressed the  importance of insurance related issues. SAMOA highlighted two  reports indicating that nearly all losses in developing countries  due to extreme events are not covered by insurance. JAPAN and  others cautioned against holding too many workshops. IRAN stressed  that the workshops should also address adaptation to the impact of  response measures. Chair Estrada called on Daniela Stoytcheva  (Bulgaria) and Enele Sopoaga (Tuvalu) to conduct informal  consultations with Parties on the terms of reference for the  workshops.

On modeling, Parties noted that additional efforts are required.  SAMOA said current models do not provide a solid basis for policy- making.

###     Matters relating to LDCs

LDC Expert Group (LEG) chair Bubu Jallow  (Gambia) reported on the second meeting of the Group and on  progress in implementing the LEG work programme. He highlighted a  workshop held in Dhaka that aimed to develop national capacity for  national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs). He noted that  the Group had decided against revising NAPA guidelines at COP-8,  preferring to do this at COP-9. The EU commended the work of the  LEG, and underscored the importance of adaptation for sustainable  development and poverty eradication.

CANADA noted that his country's adaptation support prioritizes  LDCs. The G-77/CHINA said several activities related to LDCs  outlined in decision 2/CP.7 (capacity building in developing  countries) could be undertaken before completing NAPAs. TUVALU  noted difficulty in seeking funding for NAPAs from the GEF. Chair  Estrada will draft conclusions.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

Effective  participation in the UNFCCC process: The Secretariat outlined  options and proposals for the effective participation of observers  in the UNFCCC and Protocol intersessional workshops and meetings  of limited membership bodies. CANADA, with AUSTRALIA and the EU,  advocated transparency while recognizing financial realities. The  US supported participation through new approaches, including a  constituency system.

###     Arrangements for COP/MOP-1

The Secretariat presented a paper on  the arrangements, proposing an integrated approach. The EU, CANADA,  AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, opposed by SLOVENIA, supported one combined  session for the sake of efficiency, noting some details need to be  clarified. The US stressed the need to work on budgetary issues to  ensure that its contributions are used to support the UNFCCC  process. Chair Estrada said the Secretariat would prepare  conclusions on this item.

###     Date and venue of COP-9

In the absence of an offer from the  Eastern European regional group, ITALY offered to host COP-9. The  COP President would be elected from the Eastern European region.  Delegates decided to authorize the Bureau to decide on the venue.

### OTHER MATTERS

Croatian proposal: Delegates requested the SBSTA  informal group, chaired by Jim Penman (UK), to also consider the  Croatian proposal regarding its cap for forest management. The  group will prepare draft conclusions.

# COP PLENARY

### WSSD FOLLOW-UP

Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter reported on  the outcomes of the WSSD. She noted that the Summit reaffirmed  sustainable development's central place on the international  agenda and recognized climate change as an important development  issue. She highlighted that the Johannesburg Plan of  Implementation called for: greenhouse gas emission reductions;  ratification of the Kyoto Protocol; provision of technical and  financial support and capacity building; increase of energy access  and the share of renewable energy resources; and enhancement of  synergies between the CBD, UNCCD and UNFCCC. The COP took note of  the report of the Executive Secretary.

### REPORT OF CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD

CDM Executive Board chair John Ashe  (Antigua and Barbuda) introduced the Board's first report. He  noted that it addresses, inter alia: the implementation of work  plan tasks; financial and operational procedures; communication  between the Board and stakeholders; and the draft rules of  procedure. He identified issues requiring a COP decision,  emphasizing the rules and modalities for small-scale CDM projects  and the draft rules of procedure. He announced the resignation of  a Board member from the Asia region. The EU said that further  guidance on standards and procedures is necessary. The RUSSIAN  FEDERATION supported small-scale projects. The US, with ARGENTINA,  CHILE, COLOMBIA, and VENEZUELA, argued for transparent rules of  procedure. ARGENTINA noted that some Parties hold unrealistic  expectations about the CDM. AUSTRALIA and CANADA urged Parties to  reach agreement on the rules. INDIA, with SRI LANKA, proposed  developing country concessions for accreditation of operational  entities.

### THE DELHI DECLARATION

COP-8 President Baalu invited Parties to  discuss the Delhi Declaration informally. Numerous speakers  supported the Chair's proposal for an implementation-oriented  declaration focusing on climate change and sustainable development,  building on the WSSD outcome. Several Parties proposed urging the  ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, and emphasized a focus on  adaptation and poverty eradication. Many argued for a two-pronged  approach that would stress mitigation and adaptation. Several  Annex I countries supported a forward-looking declaration that  would emphasize the need to broaden and deepen commitments  globally in preparation for the second commitment period and  beyond.

Stressing the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities, a number of developing country representatives  said Annex I Parties must take the lead, and opposed any process  that would lead to new developing country commitments. One Annex I  Party stressed economic growth as the key to environmental  progress, and the right of all to prosperity, cautioning against  burdensome targets for developing countries. Many countries  supported an emphasis on renewable energy. Others stressed energy  efficiency and advanced fossil-fuel technologies. Some delegations  called for a spirit of cooperation in the process of drafting the  Declaration. Consultations will continue informally.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### CGE

Chair José Romero said that new texts on improving the  guidelines had been received from the EU and from AUSTRALIA,  CANADA, JAPAN and the US. Parties agreed to delete several  provisions in the chair's text in accordance with a G-77/China  proposal.

### ARTICLE 6

Co-Chairs Gaye and van Ypersele convened this group in  the evening. CHINA, supported by BOTSWANA and SENEGAL, and opposed  by the EU and SRI LANKA, proposed that NGOs only be allowed to  make submissions on the work programme if requested to do so by  their national focal points. NAMIBIA stressed the importance of  tertiary level training for scientists and researchers and  proposed that the Secretariat prepare a registry of available  training resources. The Group heard divergent views on designating  an international climate change day.

### LULUCF UNDER THE CDM

Parties addressed the issue of non- permanence. The G-77/CHINA delivered a proposal that focused on:  principles; elements; and cross-cutting issues relating to non- permanence. The EU proposed a system for accounting that relies on  Temporary Certified Emissions Reduction Units (TCERs). Parties  discussed issues relating to risk, insurance, liability, and  carbon rights. They agreed on the need for formal economic  analysis of potential accounting systems. Co-Chair Sach introduced  the issue of baseline methodologies and discussions continued late  into the night.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates were overheard discussing the future of the regime  Friday evening. The informal exchange of views on the Delhi  Declaration held earlier in the day was marked by emotional  posturing on developing country commitments, the like of which was  last seen in Buenos Aires. Rumours flew about the possibility that  some developing countries might prevent mention of non-Annex I  commitments in the Declaration by demanding a new instrument on  adaptation.
