abstract: "The Seventh Conference of the Parties (COP-7) to the 1992 United  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) begins  today at the Palais des Congrès in Marrakesh, Morocco. Delegates  will focus on finalizing an agreement on the operational details  for commitments on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases under  the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. In seeking such an agreement, they will  continue negotiations held over the past three years, and will  base their discussions on political principles - the Bonn  Agreements - approved by ministers and other senior government  officials at COP-6 Part II in July in Bonn, Germany."

Delegates will take up these matters in the COP as well as in  sessions of the COP's subsidiary bodies and in formal and informal  negotiating groups. In addition, a high-level segment will be held  from 7-9 November. COP-7 is expected to close on 9 November with  the adoption of decisions and conclusions.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  the sustainability of the world's environment, human health and  well-being, and the global economy. Mainstream scientists agree  that the Earth's climate is being affected by the build-up of  greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, caused by human  activities. Despite some lingering uncertainties, a majority of  scientists believe that precautionary and prompt action is  necessary.

The international political response to climate change took shape  with the development of the UNFCCC. Adopted in 1992, the UNFCCC  sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level that would prevent  human-induced actions from leading to 'dangerous interference'  with the climate system. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March  1994. It now has 186 Parties.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin  Mandate was established by COP-1 to reach agreement on a further  step in efforts to combat climate change. Following intense  negotiations culminating at COP-3, in Kyoto, Japan, in December  1997, delegates agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits  developed countries and countries making the transition to a  market economy to achieve quantified targets for decreasing their  emissions of greenhouse gases. These countries, known under the  UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, committed themselves to reducing their  overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at least 5% below  1990 levels over the period between 2008 and 2012, with specific  targets varying from country to country. The Protocol also  provided the basis for three mechanisms to assist Annex I Parties  in meeting their national targets cost-effectively - an emissions  trading system, joint implementation (JI) of emissions-reduction  projects between Annex I Parties, and a Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM) to encourage joint projects between Annex I and  non-Annex I (developing country) Parties.

It was left for subsequent meetings to decide on most of the rules  and operational details that will determine how these cuts in  emissions are achieved and how countries' efforts are measured and  assessed. Although 84 countries have signed the Protocol, most  have been waiting for the negotiation of the operational details  before deciding whether to ratify. To enter into force, the  Protocol must be ratified by 55 Parties to the UNFCCC, including  Annex I Parties representing at least 55% of the total carbon  dioxide emissions for 1990. To date, 40 Parties have ratified the  Protocol, including one Annex I Party, Romania.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

COP-4 met in Buenos Aires,  Argentina, in November 1998, to set out a schedule for reaching  agreement on the operational details of the Protocol and for  strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC itself. This work  schedule was outlined in a decision known as the Buenos Aires Plan  of Action (BAPA). The critical deadline under the BAPA was COP-6,  where Parties were to reach agreement on a package of issues.  Critical Protocol-related issues needing resolution included rules  relating to the mechanisms, a regime for assessing Parties'  compliance, and accounting methods for national emissions and  emissions reductions. Rules on crediting countries for carbon  sinks were also to be addressed. Issues under the UNFCCC requiring  resolution included questions of capacity building, the  development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those  developing countries that are especially vulnerable to the adverse  effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized  countries to combat climate change.

Numerous formal and informal meetings and consultations were held  during 1999 and 2000 to help lay the foundations for an agreement  at COP-6. However, as COP-6 drew near, political positions on the  key issues remained entrenched, with little indication of  willingness to compromise or move forward.

### COP-6 PART I

COP-6 and the resumed thirteenth sessions of the  UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies were held in The Hague, the  Netherlands, from 13-25 November 2000. During the second week of  negotiations, COP-6 President Jan Pronk, Minister of Housing,  Spatial Planning and Environment of the Netherlands, attempted to  facilitate progress on the many disputed political and technical  issues by convening high-level informal Plenary sessions to  address the key political issues, which he grouped into four  'clusters' or 'boxes,' as follows: (a) capacity building,  technology transfer, adverse effects and guidance to the financial  mechanism; (b) mechanisms; (c) land use, land-use change and  forestry (LULUCF); and, (d) compliance, policies and measures  (P&Ms), and accounting, reporting and review under Protocol  Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of  information) and 8 (review of information).

However, by Thursday, 23 November, negotiations appeared stalled,  and President Pronk distributed a Note containing his proposals on  key issues in an attempt to encourage a breakthrough. After almost  36 hours of intense talks on the President's proposals,  negotiators could not achieve an agreement, with financial issues,  supplementarity in the use of the mechanisms, compliance and  LULUCF proving to be particular sticking points. On Saturday  afternoon, 25 November, President Pronk announced that delegates  had failed to reach agreement. Delegates agreed to suspend COP-6,  and expressed a willingness to resume their work in 2001.

### PREPARATIONS FOR COP-6 PART II

A number of meetings and  consultations were convened after COP-6 Part I in an effort to get  negotiations back on track. In late June, President Pronk  presented a consolidated negotiating text to delegates at informal  high-level consultations held in Scheveningen, the Netherlands.  The text was intended as a tool to help negotiators reach a  compromise. However, while some participants expressed the opinion  that positions did not appear to have shifted since COP-6 Part I,  others suggested that positions had possibly widened on issues  such as LULUCF, sinks in the CDM, and funding.

In addition to official preparations for COP-6 Part II, there were  a number of political developments following the meeting in The  Hague. In March 2001, the US administration declared its  opposition to the Protocol, stating that it believed it to be  'fatally flawed,' as it would damage its economy and exempted  developing countries from fully participating.

### COP-6 PART II

COP-6 Part II and the fourteenth sessions of the  UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies met in Bonn, Germany, from 16-27 July  2001. From 16-18 July, delegates met in closed negotiating groups  to reduce differences on texts for decisions on a range of issues  related to the Protocol and the UNFCCC, including financial  issues, the mechanisms, compliance, and LULUCF.

On Thursday, 19 July, the high-level segment of the resumed COP-6  began, with participants striving to make a breakthrough by  achieving agreement on a 'political' decision on key outstanding  issues. On Saturday night, after protracted consultations,  President Pronk presented his proposal for a draft political  decision outlining agreements on core elements of the BAPA.  However, in spite of several Parties announcing that they could  support the political decision, disagreements surfaced over the  section on compliance.

President Pronk held ongoing consultations on this section until  Monday morning, when the ministers finally agreed to adopt the  original political decision from Saturday, with a revised section  on compliance. The political decision - or 'Bonn Agreements' - was  approved by the ministers in Plenary late Monday morning, and  formally adopted by the COP on Wednesday evening, 25 July. High- level discussions over the weekend also resulted in a Political  Declaration by a number of developed countries, in which they  pledged additional funding for climate change activities for  developing countries.

During the remainder of the second week, delegates attempted to  clear all remaining brackets in the outstanding texts held over  from COP-6 Part I, based on the political guidance set out under  the Bonn Agreements. Although draft decisions were approved on  several key issues, delegates were unable to complete all their  work on the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF. Since not all texts  in the entire 'package' of decisions were completed, all draft  decisions were forwarded to COP-7, where delegates will attempt to  conclude their negotiations.

# INTERSESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

### PREPARATIONS FOR COP-7

A number of meetings and consultations  have taken place since COP-6 Part II in preparation for COP-7,  including workshops on good practices in P&Ms, held from 8-10  October in Copenhagen, and on Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8 held  from 4-6 October in Bonn. These workshops provided an opportunity  for government experts to consider these matters further,  including the outstanding draft decisions held over from COP-6  Part II. In addition, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) met for its 18th Plenary Session in London from 24- 29 September to adopt the Synthesis Report of its Third Assessment  Report.

### RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

In recent weeks, a number of senior  government and UN officials, including COP-6 President Jan Pronk  and COP-7 President-designate Mohamed Elyazghi, have expressed the  hope that success at COP-7 would pave the way for entry into force  of the Kyoto Protocol by the World Summit on Sustainable  Development in Johannesburg, South Africa, in September 2002. In  other related news, the European Commission confirmed late October  its position that EU members should ratify in time for the  Johannesburg Summit.

### NEGOTIATING TEXTS

Negotiations will be held on the basis of  negotiating texts carried over from COP-6 Part II (see  FCCC/CP/2001/5 and Add.2). These texts include draft decisions  still under negotiation and forwarded to COP-7 for further  elaboration, completion and adoption. The outstanding texts relate  to LULUCF, the work programme on the mechanisms, compliance, P&Ms,  and Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8. In addition, a number of  unbracketed decisions on issues such as capacity building,  technology transfer and funding under the Kyoto Protocol, have  also been forwarded to COP-7. Although negotiations on these  issues were completed at COP-6 Part II, they are part of the  'package' to be adopted at COP-7 once all outstanding texts have  been finalized and approved.

Other issues to be considered at COP-7 include input to the World  Summit on Sustainable Development and a second review of the  adequacy of UNFCCC Article 4.2 (a) and (b) (review of  commitments).
