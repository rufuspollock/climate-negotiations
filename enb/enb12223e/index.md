abstract: "Delegates to COP-9 continued to convene in meetings of the SBSTA  and SBI, and in contact and informal groups. The SBSTA considered  methodological issues, including LULUCF, development and transfer  of technology, good practices in policies and measures (P&Ms),  research and systematic observation (R&SO), and cooperation with  relevant international organizations. The SBI discussed financial  matters, including the programme budget for 2004-5 and the SCCF,  as well as: capacity building; UNFCCC Article 6 (education,  training and public awareness); implementation of UNFCCC Article  4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects); and non-Annex I national  communications. A contact group on methodological issues met in  the evening to address the review of methodological work under the  UNFCCC and Protocol."

# SBSTA

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Sinks in the CDM: Chair Thorgeirsson noted  progress on definitions and modalities on LULUCF projects under  the CDM. The EU welcomed the perceived convergence towards  temporary crediting and, with TUVALU, underscored the importance  of socioeconomic and environmental impact criteria. CANADA  recommended an insurance approach. SENEGAL, BOLIVIA, BURKINA FASO  and THAILAND stressed the importance of small-scale projects that  benefit local communities. BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, noted a  proposal submitted on socioeconomic and environmental criteria.  BOLIVIA, with INDIA and CHINA, cautioned against internationally  imposed criteria conflicting with national laws.

###     Good practice guidance and other information on LULUCF

The IPCC  presented its relevant work, including a report on Good Practice  Guidance (GPG) for LULUCF and work on factoring out direct human- induced changes in carbon stocks from indirect human-induced and  natural effects, and noted difficulties in providing a practical  methodology for factoring out for a broad range of LULUCF  activities. TUVALU, for AOSIS, stressed the need for consultation  with national experts. The US said the IPCC should not be engaged  further in GPG as current scientific knowledge is insufficient to  develop comprehensive methodologies. Chair Thorgeirsson said  Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe) and Audun Rosland (Norway)  will co-chair a contact group to develop conclusions on the GPG.

###     Harvested wood products

Chair Thorgeirsson introduced a technical  paper on estimation, harvesting and accounting of harvested wood  products. The US suggested that Parties distinguish between  exporting and importing in their reporting, while TUVALU, for  AOSIS, cautioned against approaches not accounting for products  harvested in developing countries and transferred to developed  countries. Parties agreed that this is an issue for the second  commitment period and to consider this at SBSTA-20.

###     Issues relating to registry systems under Protocol Article 7.4

Reporting on pre-sessional consultations on registries, Murray  Ward (New Zealand) emphasized the importance of cooperation  between administrators of registries and of the transaction log.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

The Secretariat presented the UNFCCC  technology information clearing house (TT:CLEAR). William Kojo  Agyemang-Bonsu, EGTT Chair, presented results of the recent EGTT  meetings, including its proposed work programme for 2004.  MALAYSIA, for the G-77/China, said developed countries have taken  insufficient steps in developing enabling environments, and  expressed concern at the EGTT's limited financial resources.  BELIZE proposed the establishment of a 'technology development  expert group.' CANADA emphasized partnerships between governments  and the private sector. Chair Thorgeirsson said Terry Carrington  (UK) and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad & Tobago) would co-chair a  contact group.

### P&MS

The EU urged Parties to submit reports to the Secretariat on  demonstrable progress and asked SBSTA to identify priority  activities and develop a work programme on good practices. SBSTA  agreed that Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) and Greg Terrill  (Australia) would conduct informal consultations.

### R&SO

The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) emphasized steps  to initiate an implementation plan and the establishment of a GCOS  Cooperation Mechanism to improve global observing systems in  developing countries. URUGUAY and BANGLADESH highlighted the  usefulness of regional cooperation, and AUSTRALIA called for  national efforts in climate observing systems. SAUDI ARABIA urged  advances in modeling impacts of response measures. The COOK  ISLANDS, for AOSIS, underscored the need for financial and  technical resources. The EU and SWITZERLAND emphasized the  importance of historical data sets. Chair Thorgeirsson said Sue  Barrell (Australia) and Philip Gwage (Uganda) would chair a  contact group.

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT ORGANIZATIONS

The CBD outlined relevant  outcomes of the ninth meeting of its Subsidiary Body on  Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice, and presented key  findings of the report of its Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group on  biological diversity and climate change. The CCD said its recent  COP-6 adopted a decision encouraging the Joint Liaison Group to  identify further areas of joint activities.

The IPCC said the deadline for nominating experts to contribute to  the Fourth Assessment Report is 20 January 2004. The UN Inter- Agency Secretariat for the International Strategy for Disaster  Reduction outlined its work on mainstreaming climate change  adaptation into disaster reduction strategies. TUVALU, with the  EU, NEPAL and SWITZERLAND stressed the importance of cooperation  with other conventions regarding LULUCF activities.

# SBI

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Interim financial  performance: SWITZERLAND noted concern over the high reliance on  voluntary contributions to priority activities in the core budget.

###     Programme budget for the biennium 2004-5

JAPAN stressed its  support for a nominal zero growth budget. The EU underlined the  importance of adequate and secure resources, and proposed that the  COP consider the adoption of the Euro as the currency for future  budgets. The US reiterated its concerns regarding the structure  and level of the budget and opposed the inclusion of the  development costs of the Protocol in the Secretariat's core  budget. With AUSTRALIA, he called for dividing the UNFCCC and  Protocol budgets. Chair Stoycheva said a contact group chaired by  John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) would prepare draft conclusions  and a draft COP decision.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

SCCF: Numerous Parties underscored  adaptation, capacity building and technology transfer as priority  areas for the SCCF. The EU said the SCCF should be a catalyst for  leveraging additional resources from bilateral and multilateral  sources. CHINA urged the establishment of a procedure for the  replenishment of the SCCF. Chair Stoycheva said a contact group,  co-chaired by Rawleston Moore (Barbados) and Frode Neergaard  (Denmark), would prepare a draft COP decision.

###     Report of the GEF

The GEF highlighted its initiatives on climate  change. TANZANIA, for the LDCs, urged an expedited procedure for  the approval of LDC national adaptation programmes of action.  CHINA and BRAZIL sought accelerated funding of second national  communications. ALGERIA expressed concern about lack of progress  and funding. Chair Stoycheva said she would prepare a draft COP  decision.

###     Additional guidance to the GEF

Chair Stoycheva requested Andrea  Albán (Colombia) to undertake informal consultations in  coordination with the relevant contact group chairs, and prepare a  draft omnibus COP decision.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the US, called for  the development of performance indicators to monitor progress in  implementing relevant COP decisions. JAPAN urged greater  coordination between the GEF and UNFCCC, and several Parties  highlighted the need to document best practice and lessons  learned. Chair Stoycheva said that a contact group, chaired by  Dechen Tsering (Bhutan), would prepare draft conclusions and a  draft COP decision.

### ARTICLE 6

The EU suggested that Parties include information in  their national communications on obstacles to implementing Article  6. The US highlighted the need for a country-driven focus, and  CHINA called for technical and financial assistance. Several  Parties highlighted the importance of regional workshops. Chair  Stoycheva requested Markus Nauser (Switzerland) to conduct  informal consultations and prepare draft conclusions and a COP  decision.

### REQUEST BY CENTRAL ASIA, THE CAUCASUS, ALBANIA AND MOLDOVA GROUP  (CACAM)

UZBEKISTAN requested a COP decision to enable CACAM to  receive financial support and its experts to be nominated and  participate in expert groups. Chair Stoycheva said she would  conduct informal consultations on the issue.

### OTHER MATTERS

Proposal by Croatia on LULUCF and special  circumstances of Croatia: CROATIA stressed the importance of  resolving the issue of its special circumstances under UNFCCC  Article 4.6 (special circumstances of EITs) and called for the  continuation of informal negotiations on the issue. BOSNIA AND  HERZEGOVINA and SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO said that the Croatian  emissions estimates and projections are based on emissions not  originating in Croatia's territory. CROATIA pointed to new  emissions estimates and projections that do not include emissions  from neighboring countries, noting that the concerns of Bosnia and  Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro are no longer relevant.  Chair Stoycheva said Jim Penman (UK) would undertake informal  consultations.

###     Status report on the review of third Annex I national  communications

The Secretariat said 36 Annex I Parties have  submitted national communications. Parties took note of this  agenda item.

###     Any other matters

On a proposal by Belarus to use 1990 as its  base-year, the EU said only COP/MOP has authority to decide on the  issue. He sought clarification on the proposal, as the new  base-year would imply a large quantity of hot air. Chair  Stoycheva said she would prepare draft conclusions on the issue.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Consideration of the fifth  compilation and synthesis of initial national communications: The  US said the document on steps taken by non-Annex I Parties to  reduce emissions does not respond appropriately to the relevant  requests made by COP-8 and SBI-18. Chair Stoycheva recalled that a  contact group chaired by S.N. Sok Appadu (Mauritius) would  consider this issue.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

Matters relating to LDCs:  La'avasa Malua (Samoa), Chair of the LDC Expert Group (LEG),  outlined outcomes of the LEG's activities, noting that many LDC  stakeholders have expressed the need for longer-term support.  Richard Muyungi (Tanzania), Chair of the LDCs, said implementation  of the LDC work programme has begun, but numerous elements of the  programme remain incomplete. BANGLEDESH, with the EU and CANADA,  supported the extension of the LEG's mandate, and, with CANADA,  highlighted complimentarity between the LDC Fund and the SCCF.  Chair Stoycheva said Mamadou Honadia (Burkina Faso) and José  Romero (Switzerland) will facilitate informal consultations on  this matter and prepare a draft COP-9 decision.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

This contact group, co-chaired by Jim  Penman and Brian Challenger (Antigua and Barbuda) addressed  elements of a possible future work programme. Co-Chair Penman  suggested distilling the essence of proposed new elements and  reducing overlaps. SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by the US, said proposals  based on current and planned activities should also be discussed.  The EU recommended rationalizing the proposals and preparing a  draft decision. The US said work is only at the information stage  and voiced concerns about duplicating work. NEW ZEALAND urged a  strategic approach. On a proposal for a data interface, AUSTRALIA  suggested initiating a pilot phase. The G-77/CHINA said limited  resources require selection of priorities and MALAYSIA urged  consideration of capacity building. On examination of proposed new  elements, the G-77/CHINA, opposed by CANADA and the US, supported  clustering items.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Affected by an apparently smooth second day of meetings, and  possibly still disoriented by the labyrinth-like Fiera conference  halls, it appeared that some participants were sleepwalking this  afternoon. The quiet atmosphere may, however, only be the calm  before the storm. Although the winds outwardly appear to have been  blowing favorably for the LULUCF negotiations so far, it remains  to be seen how delegates will react when confronted with the many  draft decisions that will be developed over the next few days.
